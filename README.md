# 4Chess

A four player chess timer app created by [Robert Quigley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quigleyrobert/) and [Deven Mallamo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deven-mallamo/). Using this app, four people can sit around a four player chess board (Or any 4 player game board that requires a descending timer) and all have their moves timed, and be able to quickly see how much time other players have.
